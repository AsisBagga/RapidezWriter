        Thankyou for choosing RapidezWriter for the perusal of your resume.
        This free resume evaluation is meant to give you an honest, straightforward assessment and some suggestions to help in your job search. I'm able to provide insight into how you compare to other job seekers competing for the same positions because I personally review hundreds of resumes every month.

    <h3 style="font-size: 22px;">Visual Presentation and Organization</h3>
    <h3 style="font-weight: 200">
        Let's talk hard truths: sometimes looks do matter, especially in the case of your resume. I found your design to be visually uneven. The appearance is not polished, and aesthetics matter at the relatively early stage of your career. The ideal resume design is clean, and uncluttered, with effective and strategic use of white space. Your resume is the first glimpse a potential employer has of you. Treat it like your personal marketing tool.
        You should consider using a few more bullet points to increase the impact to the employer. Employers can find it hard to narrow in on crucial information when there are long sections of text. The size and type of bullets should also be taken into account. Although seemingly minor, the visual impact of a resume is the key to ensuring that an employer will read it thoroughly.

    <h3 style="font-size: 22px;">Resume Writing</h3>
    <h3 style="font-weight: 200">
        Your career summary is not as strong as it should be. This is a key component to compel the hiring manager to keep reading. Expand your career summary to define you as a professional and cover those areas most relevant to your career level and job target.
        When I read your resume, I did not find the kind of compelling language that would bring your work to life. Instead, I saw passive words and non-action verbs.
        Phrases like “responsible for” and “Performed” are monotonous, overused, and add little value to your resume. Strong action verbs, used with unique phrasing to outline exemplary achievements, are essential parts of a well-constructed resume.
        Now, let's put it all together. Here's a real life example taken from a former client's resume. By changing the language, we helped to improve the perception of the job-seeker.
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li style="font-size: 18px">Passive language / Doing: “Negotiated contracts with vendors”</li>
        <li style="font-size: 18px">Action language / Achieving: “Slashed payroll/benefits administration costs 30% by negotiating pricing and fees, while ensuring the continuation and enhancements of services.”</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 style="font-weight: 200">
        A change like this makes a big improvement.
        A regular review of every word and sentence in your resume is an important thing to do, especially if you're the only one looking at it. Hiring managers are looking for an excuse to eliminate you as a candidate. You may not be able to see grammatical errors and awkward phrases if you have already spent too much time with your own resume.

    <h3 style="font-size: 22px;">Resume Scan Test Results</h3>
    <h3 style="font-weight: 200">
        93% of all Hiring Managers use resume scanning software called applicant tracking systems (ATS) to filter candidates from the application pool. To illustrate how you stand up to the automation, I passed your resume through the very same software that Hiring Managers use to filter the real talent from the hundreds, sometimes thousands, of candidates that apply for a single open position.

    <h3 style="font-size: 22px;">Recommendations & Next Steps</h3>
    <h3 style="font-weight: 200">
        For a professional with your experience, your resume undersells you. This is the most important tool in your job search and it needs to clearly communicate your expertise, unique experience, accomplishments, and career goals.

        HERE ARE THE MAJOR ISSUES HOLDING YOUR RESUME BACK:
        <ol>
            <li>Your resume does not make a strong visual impression. Your resume should appear clean, uncluttered, and appealing to the eye.</li>
            <li>Your resume needs to include more keywords and skills to help categorize you as a stronger candidate.</li>
            <li>The language in your resume is repetitive, which makes it a tiresome read and reflects poorly on your communication skills.</li>
        </ol>
